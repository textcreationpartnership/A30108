            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This not onely inferred from Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ries, but reaſon.</p>
            <p>An example of a Boy of foure yeares old, thought to be <hi>Mute,</hi> who by a naturall criſis recovered, and on a ſudden began to ſpeake; as other Boys of that age and ſo proceeded to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection of ſpeech.</p>
            <p>That it is an ancient conceit ſetled in all mens mindes, that no effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reliefe can be given to men origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>Deafe</hi> and <hi>Dumbe,</hi> but by the divine Art of miracle-working Faith.</p>

So that if a man (for curioſity or ſtrangeneſſe ſake) would make a Puppet or other dead Body, to pronounce a word; Let him conſider on the one part, the motion of the Inſtruments of the voyce; and on the other part the like ſounds made in inanimate Bodies; and what conformity there is that cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſimilitude of ſounds; and by that he may miniſter light to that effect.

               <p>SO lazie and ſluggiſh are the naturall inclinations of moſt men, that they are prone to limit the infinite capacity of man, and the effects of his admirable obſervations, to known and common Matters: whereas conſidering his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and the fertility of his Braine, there is no accident of imperfection that may befall him, but with the indulgent cooperation of Nature, he may work himſelfe either out of it, or invent a ſupply to the defect and inconveniences of it. For a notable inſtance of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious felicity of an obſerving wit in this kind, wee are extraordinarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to that Gallant and learned Knight, Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby.</hi> That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hitherto, the underſtanding of <hi>words</hi> by the <hi>motions of the Lips,</hi> hath been an
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56955:50"/>
                  <hi>Art</hi> which we have heard indeed, that many have pretended unto, yet hath been thought deceitfull and ſcarce to be credited; He affords us an Example of an Artiſt, who ſublimed this Art unto an almoſt incredible perfection.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of this rare atchievement of Art is thus delivered, by that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Relator.</p>
               <p>THere was a Nobleman of great quality that I knew in <hi>Spaine,</hi> the younger brother of the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who was taught to <hi>heare</hi> the ſounds of <hi>words</hi> with his <hi>eyes</hi> (if that expreſſion may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) this Spaniſh Lord was borne Deafe, ſo Deafe, that if a Gun were ſhot off cloſe by his eare he could not heare it, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was Dumbe; for not being able to heare the ſound of words, he could never imitate, nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them: The lovelineſſe of his
<pb facs="tcp:56955:50"/>
Face, and eſpecially the exceeding life and ſpiritfulneſſe of his Eyes, and the Comelineſſe of his perſon, and the whole compoſure of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy throughout, were pregnant ſignes of a wel-temper'd mind within. And therefore all that knew him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented much the want of meanes to cultivate it, and to embrue it with the notions, which it ſeemed to be capable of, in regard of it ſelfe, had it not been croſſed by this unhappy accident, which to remedie, Phyſitions and Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions had long employed their skill, but all in vaine. At the laſt there was a Prieſt, who undertooke the teaching him to underſtand others when they ſpoke, and to ſpeake himſelfe that others might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, for which attempt at firſt he was laughed at, yet after ſome yeares he was looked upon as if he had wrought a Miracle. In a word,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56955:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after ſtrange patience, conſtancie, and paines, he brought the young Lord to ſpeak as diſtinctly as any man whatſoever; and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo perfectly what others ſaid, that he would not looſe a word in a whole dayes converſation. I have often diſcourſed with the Prieſt whilſt I waited upon the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> (now our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign) in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and I doubt not but his Majeſty remembreth all I have ſaid of him, and much more: for his Majeſty was very curious to obſerve, and enquire into the utmoſt of it. It is true, one great misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ingneſſe he was apt to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whil'ſt he ſpoke: which was an uncertainty in the Tone of his voyce, for not hearing the ſound he made when he ſpoke, he could not ſteadily governe the pitch of his voyce, but it would be ſometimes higher, and ſometimes lower, though
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56955:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the moſt part what he delivered together, he ended in the ſame Key as he began it. But when he had once ſuffered the paſſage of his voice to cloſe, at the opening it again, chance or the meaſure of his earneſtneſſe to ſpeak or reply, gave him his Tone, which he was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of moderating by ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice as is recorded <hi>Caius Graechus</hi> uſed, when paſſion in his Orations to the People drove out his voice with too great a vehemency or ſhril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He could diſcerne in another whether he ſpoke ſhrill or low: and he would repeat after any bodie any hard word whatſoever, which the Prince tried often, not onely in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but by making ſome <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that ſerved his Highneſſe ſpeak words of their Language, which he ſo perfectly ecchoed, that I confeſſe I wondred more at that, than at all the reſt, and his Maſter himſelfe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56955:52"/>
would acknowledge that the Rules of his Art reached not to produce that effect with any certainty. And therefore concluded this in him muſt ſpring from other Rules he had framed unto himſelfe out of his own attentive obſervation; which the advantages which Nature had juſtly given him in the ſharpneſſe of Senſes to ſupply the want of this, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with an ability and ſagacity to do beyond any other man that had his Hearing. He expreſſed it ſurely, in a high meaſure by his ſo exact imitation of the <hi>Welch</hi> pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: for that Tongue (like the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>) employeth much the guttural Letters, and the motions of that part which frameth them, cannot be ſeen or judged by the eye, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the effect they may happily make by conſent in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the mouth expoſed to view. For the knowledge he had of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56955:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what they ſaid ſprung from his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the motions they made, ſo that he could converſe currently in the light, though they he talked with whiſpered never ſo ſoftly. And I have ſeen him at the diſtance of a large chambers breadth, ſay words after one, that I ſtanding cloſe by the Speaker, could not hear a ſyllable of. But if he were in the darke, or if one turned his face out of his ſight, he was capable of nothing one ſaid.</p>

               <p>THe firſt thing obſervable that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curres in this Relation is, that <hi>this Spaniſh Lord was taught to hear the ſound of words with his eye, if that expreſſion may be permitted.</hi> Indeed the exploit and expreſſion both, are very new, and may ſeem exceeding ſtrange to thoſe who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know not that there is a <hi>community</hi> among the Senſes; or have not well thought upon it. It being admirable how the objects of one <hi>Senſe</hi> may be known by another; and how one <hi>Senſe</hi> will oftentimes ſupply the office and want of another: for <hi>light</hi> may be <hi>felt, odours</hi> may be <hi>taſted,</hi> the <hi>reliſh of meates</hi> may be <hi>ſmelt, magnitude</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> may be <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>ſounds</hi> may be <hi>ſeen, felt,</hi> or <hi>taſted.</hi> Examples and Experiments of all which Exchanges I am able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce upon occaſion: ſo that to exerciſe <hi>Senſe</hi> is, our brain to receive an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from the externe object, by the

operation or mediation of ſome one of thoſe which we call an externe <hi>Senſe,</hi> yet there ſeemes to be no abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that <hi>Senſation</hi> muſt be made by an organical part made for that purpoſe, but <hi>one ſenſe</hi> may be exerciſed by the Organs of another, by changing the offices of the <hi>Senſes,</hi> which well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined would keep the moſt Sceptical from doubting of a <hi>community</hi> among them, if not of degree, at leaſt of the whole kinde: for we ſee the <hi>touch</hi> is the ground worke of all the reſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Campanella</hi> in his ingenious Book <hi>De ſenſu rerum</hi> proves, that all the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are but Tact: but the <hi>ſenſories</hi> and manner of <hi>ſenſation</hi> differ, which he makes good through all the <hi>Senſes,</hi> prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that al <hi>ſenſation</hi> is performed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact.

conformable: and therefore it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the looſing of one of them, is the loſſe alſo of the other.

And indeed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are ſomewhat remarkable, that men defective in their <hi>Senſes</hi> often uſe, which ſeem to acknowledge no defect, but what they have an equivalent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for; it being ordinary for blinde men to uſe words as if they ſaw: which I remember <hi>Montaigne</hi> in his <hi>Eſſayes</hi> takes great notice of, who was once viſited by a blinde Gentleman, who took upon him confidently to commend the Architecture and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his Manſion-houſe: What a fair lightſome room, ſaith he, is this? What a goodly proſpect this houſe hath? What a fair &amp; beautifull childe is this? Taking upon him to judge of colours and all manner of beauty and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

of the ſight and things viſible, to illuſtrate the nature of ſounds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting it to a more full compariſon, ſince the hearing hath a great affinity with the Organ of ſight, for they have both one common faculty, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the auditory paſſage, where the Nerve dilated is conjoyned with the included aire, doth anſwer to the Chryſtalline: in like manner thoſe parts which are about the involution of the <hi>Eare</hi> are correſpondent to the ſight of the <hi>Eye,</hi> and the other parts about the <hi>Chryſtalline.</hi> And I would fain know why <hi>Gordonius</hi> a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Phiſician, as appeareth by his Workes, in his Deſcription of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Hearing, where he writes of the <hi>Diſeaſes of the Ear,</hi> attributes a <hi>concave optique Nerve</hi> unto the <hi>Ear.</hi> His <hi>Marginal Commentator</hi> confeſſeth he ſeeth not for what reaſon he doth it, and till ſome bodie will undertake to ſee far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into his minde, we may ſuppoſe he was a ſecret Friend, and a well wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Nichodemus</hi> to <hi>auricular viſion.</hi> Now whether the expreſſion of <hi>hearing ſounds with the Eye</hi> may be permitted,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56955:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will appear, if it cannot be denied but that <hi>Hearing</hi> is nothing elſe but the due <hi>perception of motion,</hi> and that <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>ſound</hi> are not different entities, but in themſelves one and the ſame thing, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though expreſſed by different names and compized in our underſtanding under different notions, which is proved by the obſervation of <hi>ſounds</hi> which follow the lawes of <hi>motion,</hi> for every effect of them is to be demonſtrated by the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> and <hi>proportions</hi> of <hi>motion.</hi> So that <hi>motion</hi> alone is able to effect and give account of all things whatſoever that are attributed to <hi>ſound,</hi> and <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> do go hand in hand together, and whatſoever may be ſaid of the one is likewiſe true of the other. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> therefore defines <hi>ſound</hi> by <hi>motion,</hi> and the Voyce to be a kinde of percuſſion, and therefore <hi>ſound</hi> is the ſame with <hi>motion,</hi> and no reſulting quality; which may be further convinced by the ordinarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of perceiving Muſique by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of a ſticke: for, a deaf man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that <hi>ſound</hi> no otherwiſe than as bare <hi>motion</hi> is <hi>ſound.</hi> Now ſince <hi>articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſound or motion</hi> may be <hi>perceived</hi> by

the <hi>Eye,</hi> then it may <hi>hear</hi> as well as <hi>ſee,</hi> and <hi>hear by ſeeing.</hi> It will be no great impropriety of ſpeech to affirme the <hi>Eye</hi> may <hi>hear,</hi> ſince it can perceive the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate object of <hi>hearing,</hi> and performe the office of an <hi>ear</hi> in judging of <hi>ſound</hi> as it is <hi>motion</hi> (all <hi>ſound</hi> being <hi>motion</hi> as ſoon as it is perceived) and the thing which we call <hi>ſound</hi> and makes ſpeech audible, being purely <hi>motion.</hi> Indeed <hi>ſound</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is but an accident of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> &amp; which is as they commonly ſpeak, the <hi>ſenſible quality</hi> of <hi>Hearing,</hi> is reckoned by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers to be <hi>proprium ſenſile,</hi> to wit, to be perceptible but to one <hi>ſenſe:</hi> yet as it is <hi>figure</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> which two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes imply one another, and of the eſſence of <hi>ſpeech,</hi> it may be accounted <hi>commune ſenſile,</hi> and be perceived by more outward <hi>Senſes</hi> than one.

of Heſſe, a Boy <hi>deafe</hi> and <hi>dumbe</hi> ſo witty, that hee could not wonder e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at his dexterity in executing the commandements that were given him; for by a winke of the eye, hee conceived of the will of the Prince and of his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: The Lantgrave ſeeing him won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the ſight, hee told him: You ſee this young Boy, his uſe is to declare with a marvelous readineſſe by geſtures of his body, and by <hi>motions</hi> of his fingers, any new thing he ſeeth done in the Court or City. He is an example of Gods juſtice, for, his mother being accuſed of ſtealing when ſhee went with childe with him, uſed ſuch an imprecation, that if that which ſhe was charged with was true, her Childe might never ſpeake when it came to be in the World, but remaine Dumbe all his life.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But why Deafe men ſhould get deafe children? may be from that ſimilitude which ſpringeth from the ſeede, in as much as it flowes from the whole oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the Body; that is, ſometimes it flowes out more from the Father, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56955:61"/>
from the Mother; from this plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of proviſion proceedeth the ſimilitude, ſo ſome part in children reſembleth the Mother, another part the Father; as that ſeede hath more copiouſly iſſued from the parts of either Parent. And common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when a Deafe and Dumbe man hath got his Wife with childe, there is a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous expectation in their Friends whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the childe ſhould prove Deafe and Dumbe or no: For it falleth not out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that the children of Deafe and Dumbe men inherit that imperfection of their parents, as intailed upon them: whereof the reaſon above mentioned may ſerve, that is, the ſeed of the perfect parent may be more luxuriant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, whereof I have known ſome examples. What the iſſue of a Deafe and Dumbe man and woman would prove, there hath beene no opportunity afforded to trie, becauſe few Philoſophers have beene bidden to ſuch a wedding. The like reaſon may be, why they ſhould have deafe Children who are deafened by ſome diſeaſe, or by reaſon of ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent object which hath deſtroyed their ſenſe of Hearing. Upon which a Quaere

might be raiſed, whether the children of thoſe who dwell neere the Catarrachs of Nile (whoſe parents are all deafe,) are not commonly borne deafe alſo, rather then afterwards ſo made.</p>
               <p>We doe not heare indeed, that any of the brethren or family this Lord was of, were unfortunate in the like defect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that hath beene the ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many eminent Families. <hi>Fernelius</hi> writes of a Senatour, whoſe Wife being healthy, yet all the children hee had by her were <hi>deafe</hi> and <hi>dumbe;</hi> the cauſe he judgeth to be very darke and obſcure. <hi>Cardan</hi> ſpeakes of a woman that had five and twenty children, of two of which number ſhee was delivered within tenne moneths, both <hi>deafe</hi> and <hi>dumbe,</hi> which both lived, and lived in his time; the one with three Mola's, the ſecond with two, not onely dead but putrified; who while ſhe went with them felt not her ſelfe as with her others, but ſhee felt as it were a weight of lead in the bottome of her belly. It being very likely that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's growing to by reaſon of their fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giditie (for they are as congealed blood) did hurt their braines, thence the hearing,

the defect of ſpeech that vaniſheth away, is onely audible, and cannot bee wrought into diſcourſe but by two that are preſent together, whereas this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention puts an eare, as it were into the eye, and preſents our cogitations viſible and legible, writing being the later in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; ſpeech by it ſelfe ſignifies all our conceptions, and writing ſignifies our ſpeech; for, writing to words, is as words to cogitations: Yet this order is not of neceſſity, that ſpeech muſt bee learnt firſt, and afterwards Writing ſhould ſucceede, to ſignifie our words; rather then words writing: there being no naturall neceſſity for it, ſo that the contrary cannot bee done: But it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens rather by reaſon of the facility, and becauſe men that are deprived of no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

or the want of the <hi>Meningis,</hi> and theſe are all <hi>mute</hi> without a voyce, not without ſound, for ſound is naturall, but the voyce and ſpeech is learnt by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or altogether deſtitute they are of ſpeech, yet they utter a voyce, which is ſo far from enabling Dumbe men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their conceptions to others, that they ſeeme very unapt to doe it, neither can any underſtand Dumbe men, unleſſe thoſe who are a long time and much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with their converſation; neither could they then, unleſſe Dumbe men themſelves, beſides the voice, did adhibit diverſe geſticulations of the hand and whole body: Notwithſtanding, in as much as the voyce is naturall, it is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all men, and therefore when Dumbe men utter any ſad voyce, all men underſtand it, and will perceive the affection of the minde to be ſadneſſe; and herein Dumbe men will alſo very well underſtand one another, if they be not originally Deafe.</p>
               <p>The great noyſe and gabling which Deafe and Dumbe folks make, eſpecially when they are angry, proves them to have a ſufficient command of their voyce

               <p>The reaſon may be, That Deafe and Dumbe folke being deprived of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are not ſo capable of a ſoft anſwer or Apologie inductive to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification, which might allay and calme the tempeſt of their anger: and then wanting a vent of ſpeech, whereby others uſually denounce their indignation, they pay it with the voyce, which is the onely weapon they have left, moving their tongue, as if they would hammer and forge out ſomething equivalent to an Articulate voyce; which they manage to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; from which there reſults ſuch a noyſe, which although inarticulate, is ſignificent enough to expreſſe their paſſion and chollericke indignation.</p>

One is that the Infant in the wombe hath all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, almoſt of the ſenſes occluded, except the <hi>eares,</hi> for it hath neither the <hi>noſtrils,</hi> nor <hi>mouth,</hi> nor <hi>eyes</hi> open: Yet for the moſt part it hath the Eares wide open, and therefore it eaſily comes to paſſe that ſomewhat out of the wombe may fall into the Eares, which indeede cannot happen to the other ſenſes. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon is, that the inward inſtrument of <hi>hearing</hi> is empty, and being empty in the wombe, and a moſt moyſt head, is eaſily repleniſhed. A third reaſon is, that the <hi>auditory nerues</hi> &amp; the proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>hearing,</hi> are nearer to the braine then the other inſtruments of ſenſe, and being nearer the braine, are more p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and hence it comes to paſſe, that they are more eaſily offended. To theſe <hi>Varolius</hi> ſeemes to afford a fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or if you had rather, the third very much explained and enlarged. The riſing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56955:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſaith he, of the <hi>Auditorie nerves,</hi> from the proceſſe of the <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> as it ſhewes the uſe of the after-Braine was to be the chiefe principle of the ſenſe of Hearing: So it teacheth us the cauſe why more are deprived of their <hi>hearing</hi> from their nativitie, then of any other ſenſe: For ſince they proceede from the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellum,</hi> and are not drawne out far, they are eaſily ſtopped with the <hi>mucous</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements thereof.</p>
               <p>Another thing obſervable is, that both the <hi>Eares</hi> are alwayes affected in origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>deafeneſſe;</hi> that being the chiefe ſigne of naturall <hi>deafeneſſe,</hi> which being cauſed, almoſt, alwayes through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of the Braine, whence the cauſe being <hi>internall</hi> and common to both the <hi>Auditorie nerves,</hi> it is neceſſary that at the offence of a Principle both the <hi>nerves</hi> ſhould be offended, and conſequently, both Eeares grow Deafe.

the other ſenſes we have in one Maſter <hi>Babington</hi> of <hi>Burntwood</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> an ingenious Gentleman, who through ſome ſickneſſe becomming <hi>deaf,</hi> doth notwithſtanding feele words, and as if he had an eye in his finger, ſees ſignes in the darke; whoſe Wife diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth very perfectly with him by a ſtrange way of Arthrologie or Alphabet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived on the joynts of his Fingers; who taking him by the hand in the night, can ſo diſcourſe with him very exactly; for, he feeling the joynts which ſhe toucheth for letters, by them collected into words, very readily conceives what ſhee would ſuggeſt unto him. By which examples you may ſee how ready upon any invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Art the <hi>Tact</hi> is, to ſupply the defect, and to officiate for any or all of the other ſenſes, as being the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſenſe to man, being both the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and <hi>Vicar generall</hi> to all the reſt. So that whereas among the ſenſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us by nature, ſome are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie</hi> to life, others to a happy life; ſome to neither: without the ſenſe of <hi>Touch</hi> man can neither bee, nor live; without <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> he may indeed

Whereof it is enough for us to finde a ground for the poſſibility of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and then the perfecting of it and reducing of it to ſuch a height, as at the firſt might ſeeme impoſſible and incredible, we may leave to the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticall power of Art.
